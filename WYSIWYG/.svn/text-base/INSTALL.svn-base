== About the project ==

This extension is developed from the official Mediawiki extension: Extension:FCKeditor (which is now obsolete)
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:FCKeditor_%28Official%29

The WYSIWYG extension adds a Word-like article creation and editing experience to MediaWiki installations.
It includes the well-established toolbar, importing of formated text and tables, a real time spell-checker, undo/redo functions and more.
If SMW+ is installed, the WYSIWYG extension also provides buttons for specific functions like the Semantic Toolbar, the Query Interface etc
